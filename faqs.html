<h2><span class="odd_text">Frequently</span> Asked <span class="odd_text">Questions</span></h2>
<div id="faqs">
	
	<h3 class="question">Will my pet have to be up to date on vaccinations?</h3>
	<div class="answer">Yes, you will need to provide a current copy of your pet's rabies certificate.</div>
	
	<h3 class="question">Can you groom my cat too?</h3>
	<div class="answer">No, we are no longer accepting cats.</div>
	
	<h3 class="question">Can I see the mobile salon during my appointment?</h3>
	<div class="answer">Yes, you are encouraged to see the mobile salon before your pet is groomed but insurance prohibits visitors while grooming services are being performed.</div>
	
	<h3 class="question">How long does it take for my pet to be groomed?</h3>
	<div class="answer">Approximately 1 to 3 hours, depending on the type of pet and condition of the hair.</div>
	
	<h3 class="question">I have heard horror stories about pets dying in cage dryers, how will you dry my pet safely?</h3>
	<div class="answer">All pets are hand dried using only special pet dryers. This method is safer because your pet is not left unattended in a hot cage during the drying process.</div>
	
	<h3 class="question">Do you have to plug into my electric? What about water?</h3>
	<div class="answer">No. The Pet Spa operates on a state of the art inverter system that stores enough power to supply our needs all day long. We carry a 45 gallon fresh water tank and a 50 gallon grey water tank. Every pet is bathed in fresh water. WATER IS NOT RECYCLED BETWEEN PETS.</div>
	
	<h3 class="question">Will you bathe my pet in warm water?</h3>
	<div class="answer">Of course! Our mobile unit has a propane hot water heater that keeps our water warm from the first appointment to the last.</div>
