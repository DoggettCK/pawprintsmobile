<p>
Proof of current rabies vaccination is required.</p>

<p>As a pet owner it is your responsibility to tell us if your pet has ever bitten or injured anyone prior to scheduling an appointment.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of mobile grooming there are no guaranteed appointment times. You will receive an approximate appointment time, usually with a half hour or one hour window. If this is not possible for you, we recommend that you request the first appointment of the day. Some days this is as early as 6 am. We try our very best to be on time.</p>

<p>We accept Visa, MasterCard and cash. Payment is due when services are rendered. We do not bill.</p>

<p>Please allow your dog a chance to relieve itself prior to our arrival.</p>

<p>We require 24 hours notice for cancellations. This is so that we may offer your appointment time to another client.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for the Mobile Pet Spa to be booked several weeks to a month ahead. Pre-booking is highly recommended. Holiday appointments may book as early as 3 months ahead. Please plan accordingly.</p>

<p>New clients will receive a price estimate upon request. Please note this is only an estimate, and the actual cost could be more. De-matting is $1 per minute in addition to the groom price. If you decide after we've arrived that you do not want us to groom your pet due to costs involved or for any other reason, you will be charged the minimum fee of $60.</p>

<p>If no one is home when we arrive (a 'no show' appointment), you will be charged $60. You may be required to prepay for future appointments.</p>

<p>New clients with multiple pet households desiring to have all pets groomed during the same appointment may be required to make a nonrefundable deposit.</p>

<p>Matted (knotted hair) pets will be clipped down for their safety and comfort. We will not perform any grooming procedure that we think is a danger to your pet. We will not groom dogs experiencing kennel cough, vomiting or diarrhea until the illness has cleared up for the safety of other pets.  We do not groom injured pets or those with casts, broken bones or stitches.</p>

<p>If your dog has been sprayed by a skunk, DO NOT wet your dog with water prior to treatment. Call us immediately. If you cannot reach us, mix equal parts of vinegar and baking soda and apply it to your dog dry. Allow the mixture to soak in for up to 30 minutes, and then wash with pet safe shampoo or baby shampoo, adding more vinegar and baking soda as needed. It is best to do this outside if possible. There is a $25 fee in addition to the groom price to treat skunk odor for dogs under 50 lbs, and $35 for large or hairy dogs. Treatment of skunk odor is not absolute. You may still smell a faint trace of skunk up to 6 months later. Skunk treatment is only available to regular clients on an emergency basis.</p>

<p>The Mobile Pet Spa is closed on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and all holidays including Christmas.
